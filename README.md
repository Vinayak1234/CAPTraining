## CAP Services using java

#### Download the CAPTraining java project from git

```
  git clone https://github.com/Vinayak1234/CAPTraining.git 
  cd projects/CAPTraining
  git checkout capjavaUnit1  
```

Or you can follow the below steps to create and run/deploy this hands-on exercise.

#### 1.  Create CAPTraining java project

1. To create CAPTraining project navigate to projects folder and execute the below maven command.

```

mvn -B archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=cds-services-archetype -DarchetypeGroupId=com.sap.cds \
-DarchetypeVersion=1.3.0 -DcdsVersion=3.31.2 \
-DgroupId=com.sap.cap -DartifactId=CAPTraining -Dpackage=com.sap.cap.CAPTraining

```

&nbsp;

This will initialize the application using the maven archetype `cds-services-archetype` and create your project as follows:

* The project is named `CAPTraining`.
* The `db` folder will have database-related artifacts.
* The `srv` folder will have your Java code.

&nbsp;

2. Create the schema.cds under CAPTraining>db  for creating entities.

 ```
  
  namespace sap.ibso.captraining;


  entity Books {
    key ID : Integer;
    title  : String(111);
    descr  : String(1111);
    author : Association to Authors;
    stock  : Integer;
    price  : Decimal(9,2);
  }

  entity Authors {
    key ID : Integer;
    name   : String(111);
    dateOfBirth  : Date;  
    placeOfBirth : String;  
    books  : Association to many Books on books.author = $self;
  }

```

3. Create Admin-Service.cds under CAPTraining>srv for creating admin services.

```
using { sap.ibso.captraining as my } from '../db/schema';

service AdminService {

    entity Books as projection on my.Books;

    entity Authors as projection on my.Authors;
}
```

4. Remove existing dependencies and add below mentioned dependencies to CAPTraining>srv>pom.xml.

```

	<dependencies>
	    <dependency>
		<groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
		<artifactId>cds-starter-spring-boot-odata</artifactId>
	    </dependency>

	    <dependency>
	       <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
	       <artifactId>cds-feature-hana</artifactId>
	    </dependency>

	     <dependency>
		<groupId>org.xerial</groupId>
		<artifactId>sqlite-jdbc</artifactId>
	      </dependency>

	      <dependency>
		<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
		<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-test</artifactId>
		<scope>test</scope>
	       </dependency>

	       <dependency>
		  <groupId>com.sap.cds</groupId>
		  <artifactId>cds-feature-cloudfoundry</artifactId>
		</dependency>
        
	</dependencies>
  
```


#### 2. Setup SQLITE for local development:

1. Install the sqlite

    `npm install --save-dev sqlite3`

2. Build cds objects

    `cds build/all`

3. Deploy the DB objects to local sqlite

    `cds deploy --to sqlite`

4. Start your application by running mvn spring-boot:run in the terminal and open it in a new tab.

    `mvn spring-boot:run`
    

#### 3. Setup hana and deploy the project to cf:

1. Execute the below command to add configuration for SAP HANA deployment

    `cds add hana`

2. in package.json change the requires part as shwon below to push the project models to cf.

Change from 
    ```
    "requires": {
      "db": {
        "kind": "sqlite"
      }
    }
    ```
    
    To 
    ```
    "requires": {
      "db": {
        "kind": "sqlite",
        "[production]": {
          "kind": "hana",
          "model": [
            "db/",
            "srv/",
            "app/",
            "schema",
            "services"
          ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```

3. Execute the below command to add an mta.yaml file out of CDS models and config. The file will be created under project root folder (CAPTraining/mta.yaml)

    `cds add mta`
    
  mta.yaml file is responsible to define each part of your project, the resources necessary to execute this project, and the connection link between their modules.
  
4. Remove the production params from mta.yaml (CAPTraining/mta.yaml) file build-parameters since we will be deploying the mtar file to our dev or test instance.

    From:
    ```
    build-parameters:
      before-all:
       - builder: custom
         commands:
          - npm install --production
          - npx -p @sap/cds-dk cds build --production
    ```

    Change to:

    ```
    build-parameters:
      before-all:
       - builder: custom
         commands:
          - npm install
          - npx cds build
    ```

5. Build the project from terminal, that will generate mtar (CAPTraining_1.0.0.mtar) file under CAPTraining/mta_archives/CAPTraining_1.0.0.mtar

    `mbt build`

6. Deploy the project to CF:

    `cf deploy ./mta_archives/CAPTraining_1.0.0.mtar`
    
    On successful deploy the terminal console looks like this and copy the service url from console as highlighted below.
      
    	
	Staging application "CAPTraining-srv"...
	Application "CAPTraining-srv" staged
	Starting application "CAPTraining-srv"...
	Application "CAPTraining-srv" started and available at **2d77a5b8trial-dev-captraining-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com**
	Skipping deletion of services, because the command line option "--delete-services" is not specified.
	Process finished.
	Use "cf dmol -i 0b8c38fb-0865-11eb-8372-eeee0a9e2566" to download the logs of the process.
 
    Copy the highlighted url to browser.
    
    https://2d77a5b8trial-dev-captraining-srv.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com/
    
    That will look like this with the list of services. Click on any service to fetch the details.
